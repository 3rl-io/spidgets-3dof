*Experimental Android setup uses the device's integrated IMU instead of headset drivers, and therefore doesn't require installation. If your use case is mobile-only, see [spidgets-mobile](https://github.com/3rl-io/spidgets-mobile) for a simpler repo and instructions for Termux.

## Installation

### Linux

1. Clone this repo and open it in a terminal

2. Run `chmod u+x ./bin/ar-server`

3. Place the headset upright on a flat surface

4. Run `sudo ./bin/ar-server` and wait for [calibration](#calibration)

Optional: Follow the udev step [here](https://github.com/3rl-io/headset-utils?tab=readme-ov-file#build-and-run) for non-su

### Windows

1. Clone this repo and open it in a powershell terminal

2. Place the headset upright on a flat surface

3. Run `bin/ar-server` and wait for [calibration](#calibration) (first time setup)


### MacOS

Skip to the [manual build](#manual-build)

### Android

Android skip to the webserver step in the [manual build](#manual-build). 


---
Optional: Some third party websites (e.g. YouTube) need [this extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe) in order to bypass restrictions caused by iframe headers. This may violate third party TOS or void warranties. Use at your own risk. On Android, extensions seem to only be available with Kiwi or Yandex browsers.

Soon: When stable, we can host an easier download/install process on a CDN + option to run in background on startup

---

## Usage

Run `bin/ar-server` in a terminal

Browse to http://localhost:8000

Experiment with simple HUDs by editing [webroot/index.html](https://github.com/3rl-io/spidgets-3dof/blob/master/webroot/index.html). Stay tuned for more interactive examples and docs.

Options:
- Change port with the `--port` flag e.g. `bin/ar-server --port 3000`
- Pre-record 10 seconds of motion data to allow testing without a headset using the `--record` flag. See `webroot/compat` for mock data example.
- Calibrate for drift with the `--cal` flag. Refer to the [calibration section.](#calibration)

## How it works

### ... with headset IMU driver (Windows, Linux, MacOS)

1. Rust driver `euler_60` reads the raw sensor data from the glasses and outputs euler angles (i.e. roll, pitch, and yaw) at 60Hz. [Source](https://github.com/3rl-io/headset-utils)

2. Server-side JS process `ar-server` manages the connection, corrects for yaw drift, and exposes the euler angles on a socket.io connection. Also exposes functions like re-centering and power save mode

3. Front-end in [webroot/index.html](https://github.com/3rl-io/spidgets-3dof/blob/master/webroot/index.html) listens to the websocket and uses `spidgets-core` to position the widgets and convert euler angles to matrix3d calculations to simulate 3D space

### ... on Android

Front-end in [webroot/index.html](https://github.com/3rl-io/spidgets-3dof/blob/master/webroot/index.html) uses `spidgets-core` to position the widgets and convert `deviceorientation` events in the browser to matrix3d calculations to simulate 3D space

## Student, Researcher, and OEM Info

Connect new IMU devices by replacing `bin/euler_60` driver with your own stdout program binary

Expected format:

```
...
   0.03188  -0.48346  -0.00605
   0.03174  -0.48465  -0.00596
   0.03166  -0.48591  -0.00588
   0.03196  -0.48720  -0.00600
...
```

i.e.

`{whitespace}{pitch radians}{whitespace}{yaw radians}{whitespace}{roll radians}`

Printed at or above target refresh rate

Then go to [installation](#installation). For dev support, open an issue or contact: hello@3rl.io

---

## Manual Build

Windows, Linux: see if the euler angles from your glasses are printing to the console by running the below command. If not, build [headset-utils](https://github.com/3rl-io/headset-utils) and copy the new euler_60 binary to the same location.

```
bin/euler_60
```

MacOS do the same with this instead:

```
bin/euler_60_apple_silicon
```

Android doesn't need euler_60.

---

Then get the webserver ready. Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) or [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

Start ar-server.js. You may need `sudo` for the second step:

```
bun install
bun ar-server.js
```

then browse to http://localhost:8000

### Deployment
Create the main executable for end users:

```
bun build ./ar-server.js --compile --outfile bin/ar-server
```

---
## Calibration

Calibration is a one-minute process that measures yaw drift rate and saves it for later. This process will run automatically during first time setup. It can also be run manually like so:

`bin/ar-server --cal`

The headset should be placed upright on a flat stable surface for the full 60 seconds. Console messages will indicate when the process is complete and the UI is ready.

At this time we don't store config profiles per-headset, so calibration will need to be re-run if multiple headsets are used

Optional: If the headset is usually used at a different angle than upright (e.g. in a recliner), it would be more accurate to wear it during calibration. Measurement starts 5 seconds after the command to allow time to adjust. The user can move freely during the test but should be in roughly the same orientation at T+5 and T+60.

### Performance tips

- With Rokid glasses, use a 120Hz display mode (either 1920x1080 or x1200 is okay). 60Hz creates input lag
- iframes of third party websites can be very GPU-intensive especially if they have a lot of divs. See `webroot/widgets` for ideas for building performant widgets. [HTML custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) are the cleanest pattern.
- If you have a discrete GPU, you may want to change your OS settings to use it for the browser. Most browsers will use the iGPU by default
